# Sarufi Telegram chatbot blueprint

A blueprint for deploying telegram bots made using [Sarufi](https://docs.sarufi.io/)

## GETTING READY

- Create Project directory

  Create a project directory `Telegram bot`. In this directory we are going to create a virtual environment to hold our package.

  ```bash
  mkdir 'Telegram bot'
  cd 'Telegram bot'

  ```

- Make virtual environment and install requirements

  Using virtual environment is a good practice, so we are going to create one. You can read more on [why use virtual environment](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/). We shall install all necessary packages in the environment

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv sarufi
  source sarufi/bin/activate
  ```

- Creating a telegram bot

  To create a chatbot on Telegram, you need to contact the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather), which is essentially a bot used to create other bots.

  The command you need is /newbot which leads to several steps. Follow the steps then you will have you `bot's token`

## CONFIGURATION

In this part, we are going to clone the [Sarufi Telegram Chatbot deployment Blueprint](https://github.com/Neurotech-HQ/telegram-chatbot-blueprint.git) and install the packages.

- Clone and install requirements.

  Run the commands below

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Neurotech-HQ/telegram-chatbot-blueprint.git
  cd telegram-chatbot-blueprint
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Getting Sarufi credentials.
  
  To authorize our chabot, we are are going to use authorization keys from sarufi. Log in into your [sarufi account](https://sarufi.io). Go to your Profile on account to get Authorization keys(client ID and client secret)

- Environment variables

  After installing packages, we need to configure our credentials. In `telegram-chatbot-blueprint`, create a file(`.env`) to hold environment variables.

  In `.env`, we are going to add the following credetials. Using your favourite text editor add the following:-

  ```text
  sarufi_api_key = your API KEY
  sarufi_bot_id= bot id
  token = telegram token
  start_message= Hi {name}, Welcome To {bot_name}, How can i help you
  ```

## LAUNCH

Its the time you have been waiting for. Lets lauch ðŸš€ our bot.

```python
python3 main.py
```

Open your telegram app, search for your bot --> Send it a text. You can see a sample bot [below](#sample-bot-test)

**NOTE:** All operations are done in activated virtual environment for convience

## Running in replit

Clone [telegram blueprint](https://replit.com/@neurotechafrica/sarufi-telegram-blueprint) and add your secret keys. Navigate to your tools in replit --> secrets --> add your secret keys

![Replit tools section](img/replit-tools.png)

|Secret key           | value|
|---                  |---|
|sarufi_api_key     |Your sarufi API KEY|
|sarufi_bot_id        | bot id|
|token                |telegram token|
|start_message        |Hi {name}, Welcome To {bot_name}, How can i help you|
